Viruses and malware are everywhere and they take advantage of unpatched vulnerabilities in devices, be it computers or mobile devices. Software and operating system updates are released for a reason - updates close off discovered security holes/vulnerabilities and prevent them from being exploited. However, if updates are not applied, the holes remain open to exploitation. So, always update your operating system and individual software. 

It's important to update individual software as well because they may contain holes that allow systemwide access. Individual software are individually updated and not part of OS updates.

## Updating operating systems
Check updates daily!

### Windows:
For Windows, just use Windows Update to check for updates and even after applying updates, keep checking until no more updates are available, because some updates require previous updates to be installed first as a prerequisite. _**Don't count on Windows to automatically install updates either**_.

### Mac OS:
- For **Mac OS 10.14.x Mojave**, just go into System Preferences -> Software Update and let it check for updates by itself once first. Then, press Command+R to force the page to check again for new software, as the first update check does not always show available updates.

- For **earlier macOS versions**, open the Mac App Store and go into the Updates tab. Press Command+R to force the page to reload and check for updates.

- Major OS upgrades (e.g. 10.13.x -> 10.14.x) will require a manual download and installation by searching for it in the App Store. The installer file is usually around 6GB in size.

### Android and iOS
- Search for it in your device's settings.

### Individual software:
- Dive into the app's settings and search for the option to update it. E.g. in Chrome, click on the hamburger menu button -> About Google Chrome. It will then scan for updates.
- For apps distributed through an app store, head to the app store and look for the updates section.
