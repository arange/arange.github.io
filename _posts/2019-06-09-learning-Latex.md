# Long URL in bibliography section
## Problem
Recently I find it really annoying having the urls in my citation exceeding the page bounds. This happens particularly when I'm using the bibliography style of "**IEEEtran**".  
Here are my **settings** before solving the problem:

* Software: [overleaf](http://overleaf.com) [online]  
* Compiler: pdfLaTex  
* Bibliographystyle: IEEEtran  
~~~~~
