Hello everyone who's reading this, I'm glad you just found another place to chill out.

### Thanks

Many thanks to [daattali](https://github.com/daattali) who created this [*Beautiful project*](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) that allows me to build this website in minutes! You should be able to see how many stars and forks and follows this project has gained right under the subtitle of this article.

### Testing

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes

### Notification

**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
